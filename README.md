This is currently in early development, and may or may not be completed in the next century.

WZC is intended to be a top-down, fairly realistic military simulator. Which is somewhat of a tall order, given my previous experiences with game development. In any case, the intention is for WZC to someday have AI-controlled squads that can be managed through commands (going around and shooting other AI-controlled squads), buildings, vehicles and what not.

Right now (after 2 days of development), this is the feature list:
* doesn't crash
* code is fairly organized
* can display text in boxes
* can display a blank slate and claim it's a map
* can pan the map around

The following features should be added in a couple of years:
* displaying objects on the map (units, buildings)
* keyboard selection of objects

There's a long-term to-do list at the end of main.lua.

This proto-game is powered by [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org/), a fairly awesome library.
